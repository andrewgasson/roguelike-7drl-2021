## Goal
Create a simple Roguelike inspired by the the original Rogue and OD&D using Raylib. This will include procedural dungeons, combat, and loot, and if time allows for it, magic, archery, and shops.

## Log
### Day 1 (2021/03/8)
The objective of the day was to implement a basic terminal with player creature movement, rendering, and collisions. This was achieved.

### Day 2 (2021/03/9)
The objective of the day was to implement a view system that handles both GUI and game control. This also included drawing functions for the terminal. This was mostly achieved. The view and view-controller system was implemented. However, the terminal drawing tools are unfinished, which means views such as the prompts are also incomplete. The game and its associated default game view still runs.
