## Goal
Create a simply Roguelike (inspired by the the original Rogue and OD&D). This will include procedural dungeons, combat, and loot. If time allows for it, hopefully also magic, archery, and shops.

## Log
### Day 1 (2021/8/03)
The objective of the day was to implement a basic terminal (using Raylib) with player creature movement, rendering, and collisions. This was achieved.
